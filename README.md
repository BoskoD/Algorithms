# Note to Myself

| Topic  | Algorithm  | Suggestion |
| :------------ |:--------------- |:----- |
| Array, HashTable      | TwoSum | Use Dictionary as hash table to add target - nums[i] and calculate two sum |
| String, Stack         | ValidParentheses | Use Stack to follow open brackets whenever mapping contains checked key |
| Array, HashTable, Recursion | ContainsDuplicate | Try to add nums in HashSet, if they cannot be added we have a duplicate |
| LinkedList, Recursion | MergeTwoSortedLists | Use recursive apporach to check cases when list1.val < list2.val and the opposite |
